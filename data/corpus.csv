2	It's a known fact that fifa is as corrupt as can be and for a long time,and their president making a total fool of himself by giving Trump a peace price.  Why do all the members(and especially the big leagues)accept that and don't seperate themselves from fifa and start fresh with a new organisation?	Reddit
3	"Hey everyone, as stated above I am 18yo and haven't played football in a very long time. I did play for like 1-2 yrs when I was 11/12 and would say I was pretty good back then, was able to shoot and was selected at the state level.      But overtime, post covid, I got into different sports and have gradually lost touch with football. Honestly, I'd say I am back at square one.   Recently I got into college, and  everyone here plays football. They all hangout all the time, talk about games and honestly I wanna get into that group too. Moreover, I also have become very interested in football again. There's like this inner drive within me which wants to learn and enjoy this sport.     My question is, if you had start learning football all over again, what would you do? I am not really aiming for anything big, just being good enough to play with friends/ college mates and being considered a generally ""good"" player is what I want. I am ready to put in 1-2 hrs daily to practice and get better at the game.     Any advice would really be appreciated!!     **TLDR**: How'd you go about learning football as a complete beginner at 18, to be good enough to be decent with friends/college mates."	Reddit
10	Because of the relatively rigid coupling between the upper dentition and the skull, instrumented mouthguards have been shown to be a viable way of measuring head impact kinematics for assisting in understanding the underlying biomechanics of concussions. This has led various companies and institutions to further develop instrumented mouthguards. However, their use as a research tool for understanding concussive impacts makes quantification of their accuracy critical, especially given the conflicting results from various recent studies. Here we present a study that uses a pneumatic impactor to deliver impacts characteristic to football to a Hybrid III headform, in order to validate and compare five of the most commonly used instrumented mouthguards. We found that all tested mouthguards gave accurate measurements for the peak angular acceleration (mean relative error, MRE < 13%), the peak angular velocity (MRE < 8%), brain injury criteria values (MRE < 13%) and brain deformation (described as maximum principal strain and fiber strain, calculated by a convolutional neural network based brain model, MRE < 9%). Finally, we found that the accuracy of the measurement varies with the impact locations yet is not sensitive to the impact velocity for the most part.	Arxiv
11	We prove that every spherical football (also known as a spherical soccer ball) is a branched cover, branched only in the vertices, of the standard football made up of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. We also give examples showing that the corresponding result is not true for footballs of higher genera. Moreover, we classify the possible pairs (k,l) for which football patterns on the sphere exist satisfying a natural generalisation of the usual incidence relation between pentagons and hexagons to k-gons and l-gons.

12	In this paper we examine the detailed theory of the American football in flight, with spin and air resistance included. We find the theory has much in common with the theory of a gyroscope and also rocket trajectory with a misaligned thruster. Unfortunately most of the air resistance data, for rocketry and ballistics, is for speeds of Mach 1 or higher, where the air resistance increases dramatically. We shall approximate a realistic air resistance, at the slower speeds of football flight, with a drag force proportional to cross sectional area and either $v$ or $v^2$, depending on speed, where $v$ is velocity of the football. We begin with a discussion of the motion, giving as much detail as possible without the use of complex analytic calculations. We point out the previous errors made with moments of inertia and make the necessary corrections for more accurate results. We show that the shape of an American football closely resembles a parabola of revolution.	Arxiv
13	The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of predictive modelling for football injuries. This work was conducted in close collaboration with Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participation of Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW).   Three investigations were conducted:   1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injury recordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries in professional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injury recordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used in order to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learning models is then improved by using feature selection conducted through correlation-based subset feature selection and random forests.   2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: The relationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) in professional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A common problem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athlete can affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict the number of days a player can train before he gets injured.   3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements: A significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtraining and fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provide indicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense training sessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gathered during training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whether an injury would take place during a week.	Arxiv
14	The transfer of football players is an important part in football games. Most studies on the transfer of football players focus on the transfer system and transfer fees but not on the transfer behavior itself. Based on the 470,792 transfer records from 1990 to 2016 among 23,605 football clubs in 206 countries and regions, we construct a directed footballer transfer network (FTN), where the nodes are the football clubs and the links correspond to the footballer transfers. A systemic analysis is conduced on the topological properties of the FTN. We find that the in-degrees, out-degrees, in-strengths and out-strengths of nodes follow bimodal distributions (a power law with exponential decay), while the distribution of link weights has a power-law tail. We further figure out the correlations between node degrees, node strengths and link weights. We also investigate the general characteristics of different measures of network centrality. Our network analysis of the global footballer transfer market sheds new lights into the investigation of the characteristics of transfer activities.	Arxiv
